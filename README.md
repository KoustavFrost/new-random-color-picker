# new-random-color-picker

Backstory: So when I first started learning web development with html, css and vanilla js, the first website which I created was a randomised color picker. I did a web development course back then and they gave me a domain for 6 months. I created a portfolio website along with the random color picker. Sooner or later the domain expired as I didn't have any money to pay. 
Just to recreate that nostalgia, I have created the same thing but now with ReactJs. 
Currently hosted on Heroku https://generaterandomcolors.herokuapp.com/. I am trying to get back my domain.

### How to setup:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```.
3. ```npm start``` or the yarn equivalent.

### TODOS:
- [x] Revamp the UI from the basic unresponsive one.
- [ ] Add portfolio
- [ ] Host on a actual domain

Happy Coding :)
